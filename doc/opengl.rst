=============
Modern OpenGL
=============

OpenGL has evolved over the years and a big change occured in 2003 with the
introduction of the dynamic pipeline (OpenGL 2.0), i.e. the use of shaders that
allow to have direct access to the GPU.

Before this version, OpenGL was using a fixed pipeline and you may still find a
lot of tutorials that still use this fixed pipeline. This introduces some
radical changes in the way of programming OpenGL and makes it both more
difficult to program but far more powerful.
