    A subscene can be a child of a Canvas or a ViewBox. It is a
    placeholder for the transform to make the sub scene appear as
    intended. It's transform cannot be mannually set, but its set
    automatically and is based on three components:

      * Viewbox transform: a scale and translation to make the subscene
        be displayed in the boundaries of the viewbox.
      * Projection transform: the camera projection, e.g. perspective
      * position transform: the inverse of the transform from this
        subscene to the camera. This takes care of position and
        orientation of the view.

    TODO: should camera, lights, etc. be properties of the subscene or the
    viewbox? I think of the scene. In that way canvas.scene can simply
    be a subscene.
