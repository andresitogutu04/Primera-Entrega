A brief explanation of how cameras work 
---------------------------------------

The view of a camera is determined by its transform (that it has as
being an entity) and its projection. The former is essentially the
position and orientation of the camera, the latter determines field of
view and any non-linear transform (such as perspective).

The projection must return such a transform that the correct view is
mapped onto the size of the viewbox measured in pixels (i.e.
event.resolution).

The subscene actually has a thrird transform, the viewbox_transform,
which is set by the viewbox and which takes care of the mapping from
pixel coordinates to whatever region the viewbox takes in its parent
viewbox.

    Next to the normal transformation, a camera also defines a

    instance be orthographic, perspective, log, polar, etc.
    
    Cameras are also responsible for handling any user input that
