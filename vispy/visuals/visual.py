        Draw this visual now.
        The default implementation does nothing.
        
        This function is called automatically when the visual needs to be drawn
        as part of a scenegraph, or when calling 
        ``SceneCanvas.draw_visual(...)``. It is uncommon to call this method 
        manually.
        
        The *transforms* argument is a TransformSystem instance that provides 
        access to transforms that the visual
        may use to determine its relationship to the document coordinate
        system (which provides physical measurements) and the framebuffer
        coordinate system (which is necessary for antialiasing calculations). 
        
        Vertex transformation can be done either on the CPU using 
        Transform.map(), or on the GPU using the GLSL functions generated by 
        Transform.shader_map().

            Describes the type of boundary requested. Can be "visual", "data",
