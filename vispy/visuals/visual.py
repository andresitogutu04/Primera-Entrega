    Abstract class representing a drawable object.

    At a minimum, Visual subclasses should extend the draw() method. 

    Events:

    update : Event
        Emitted when the visual has changed and needs to be redrawn.
    bounds_change : Event
        Emitted when the bounds of the visual have changed.

    Notes
    -----
    - When used in the scenegraph, all Visual classes are mixed with
    `vispy.scene.Node` in order to implement the methods, attributes and
    capabilities required for their usage within it.
